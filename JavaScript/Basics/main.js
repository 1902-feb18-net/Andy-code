// JS is the web's programming/scripting language
// was made by Netscape during the browser wars

// ECMA has standardized JS w/ cooperation of all major vendors
// ECMAScript Version 5 (ES5)
// modern baseline version that all decent browser support

// the next version is called ES6 (aka ES2015)
// then we had ES2016 (aka ES7 etc)

// what we are going to be writing in is a subset of ES6

// what web dev in 2019 write is a subset of ES6 
// (this is what browser currently supporting)


// JS is dynamically types
// vars are not locked to a given type
// that doesn't mean that JS doesn't have types
