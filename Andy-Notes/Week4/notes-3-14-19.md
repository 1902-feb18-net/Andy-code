## Extras
- azure devops: Organization settings, can check retention and parallel settings
	- check minutes used up and free status etc
- [Install docker toolbox](https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/toolbox_install_windows/)


## Docker
- **Containerization** approach in sw dev in which an app or service, its dependencies and configs are packaged together as a container image.
	- can test that containerized app as a unit and delpoy as a container image instance to the OS
	- allows devs and IT to deploy across env with little or no mods
	- containers isolate apps from each other on shared OS
		- run on top of container host that then runs on OS 
		- faller footprints than a VM image
	- scalability: scale out quickly by creating new containers for short term tasks
	- summary: isolation, portability, agility, scalability, and control across app lifecycle workflow
- Open sourced project for automating delpoyment of apps as portabl, self-sufficient containers that run on cloud or on-premises
- comparison between VMs and Docker Containers
	- ![Comparison for VMs and Docker containers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/containerized-lifecycle-architecture/media/image3.png "vms vs docker")
- **container image**: package with dep and info needed to create a container
	- image includes all dep (e.g. frameworks) + deployment and execution fonfigs used by container runtime
	- immutable once created
- **container**: instance of a Docker image
	- image is a static representation of the app or service and its config and dependencies
		- store images in a registry that acts as a library of images
	- represents execution of a single app, procss or service.
	- contains content of docker image, exec env, and set of instructions
	- when scaling project you create multiple instances of a container from same image
