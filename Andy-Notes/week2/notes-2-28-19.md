# Revature Notes for 2/28/19

## SQL stuffs!
- Multiplicity
	- 1 to 1 	-> 1 table, or 2 tables, FK UIQUE
	- 1 to N 	-> 2 tables - FK NOT NULL
	- 0/1 to N 	-> 2 tables FK NULL
	- N to N 	-> 3 tables, the middle one "junction table", "join table" with 2 FK
- **transaction**
	- a sequence of operations performed (using one or more SQL statements) on a database as a single logical unit of work
	- every statment is a transaction
	- **ACID**
		- A: *atomic*, all operations succeed 100% or do nothing at all 
		- C: *consistent*, operations should not be allowed to violate constraints
		- I: *isolated*, even if multiple transactions run concurrently, it should be AS IF each was running along (transactions shouldn't interfere with each other)
		- D: *durable*, transactions incomplete until written to persistent storage (written to hard disk in some fashion)
		- e.g. `INSERT INTO Table VALUE; (   ), (   ), ( ERROR (~~~))`
			- SELECT: check account balance, UPDATE: withdraw funds, UPDATE: deposit in other account
	- From Table 1, higher up is more performance, further down is more isolation
	- Multi statement transaction
		- BEGIN TRANSACTION
			- U
			- U  IF ~
			- S  	ROLLBACK TRANSACTION
		- COMMIT TRANSACTION; 

### Tables

| Issue | Isolation level that fixes issue  |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
|  | read_uncommitted |
| dirty read (see other transactions unfinished work) | read_committed (default) |
| nonrepeatable read (read row twice, another finished transaction changed it in between) | repeatable_read |
| Phantom read (other transactions can insert  rows that meet conditions I'm filtering on) | serializable |
