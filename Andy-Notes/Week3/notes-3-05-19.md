# Revature notes 3-05-19
This is the ASP.NET, MVC, HTML, CSS Week! Woohoo!

## HTML
- Stands for: *Hyper Text Markup Lanuguage*
- old HTML -> HTML4
	- browser wars back then, where each browsers each had their own version of HTML
	- Now more standardized in HTML4 where HTML is shared across browsers (not all)
		- first version to include cascading style sheets as part of the HTML standard
		- HTML4 is now reliant on style sheets to provide precise control of data within the page.
	- HTML4 -> XHTML
		- Idea of giving structure: strict subset of XML
		- error handling well defined
		- XXXXXXX we skipped XHTML and went straight to HTML5 XXXXXXXXXX
	- HTML4 -> HTML5
		- living standard
			- W3C, WWW Consortium
			- WHATWG: Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group
			- Consistency in Handling Malformed Documents
			- Better Web Application Features
			- Improved Element Semantics
- Separation of Concerns
	- HTML
		- structure, semantics
		- text content
	- CSS
		- Cascading Style sheets
		- tells us about appearance, layout, presentation
	- JavaScript
		- dynamic client side behavior
- Syntax
	- Element: `<tagname attributename = "attribute-value"> contents </tagname>` 
		- `input` and `img` doesn't have closing tags 
			- self-closing tag `<input attr="val" />`
		- if you need list of values in attr: space separated
			- e.g. `data = "1 2 3"`
	- Attributes: some 'global'
		- `id, class, title, style, "on _" event handlers`
			- id: identifier for this element, unique on page
			- class: groups of elements for css/js to target
			- title: hover tool tip text
			- style: inline css (bad in a sense)
- Browser -> sends request for page and receives back an ip address
	- goes to DNS and finds ip address of the webpage and sends it back
	- Browser -> server: GET /index.html, http request
		- GET: method/verb 
		- we get back a HTTP response
- Forms uses POST method and not GET method
	- (response body)
		- has things like name = "bob", email = `"a@gmail.moc"`
	- at end of URL after ? is a query
