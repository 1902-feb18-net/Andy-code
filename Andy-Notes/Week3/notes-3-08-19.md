## More MVC stuffs
- ways to get data from the controller to the view
	1. strongly typed view the model
		- often will be a view model
		- view can only take one model, so if you need several
			- either that's a collection type of some kind or
			- make a new view model that contains the several you need
	2. ViewData - a key-value pair dictionary
		- this obj is reachable via a property on Controller
		- can assign values in controller and access in the view
		- (during the same HTTP request! It's cleared between requests)
		- Designed around request response, ViewData disappears betweens requests
		- e.g. `ViewData["numOfMovies"] = viewModel.Count;`
			- then within some view we use like this, relying on this not as good
			- `<h4>Num of movie: @ViewData["numOfMovies"]</h4>`
	3. e.g. `ViewBag.numOfMovies = viewModel.Count`
		- `<h4>Num of movie: @ViewBag.numOfMovies</h4>`
		- **ViewBag** a different way to access ViewData = "dynamic" type.
			- set properties instead of using indexing syntax w/ string.
			- an obj whose operations will be resolved at runtime
			- dynamic type - compile time type checking turned off
				- we can add new props to that obj at any time
	4. TempData - a K V pair dictionary
		- the value inside it survives across req "magically"
		- by default stored using cookies sent to the client
		- which are then sent back to server on subsequent req
			- but we can configure other providers for TempData in Startup
		- e.g. we can use this to incrementally build some model
			- needing many forms to be submitted, not just one
		- with regular ["key"] access, the value you access gets deleted.
			- only after the current request, circumvent with methods 
				- .Peek("key")
					- access value w/o marking for deletion
				- .Keep("key")
					- unmarks a value for deletion
		- ```cshtml
<h4>Counter (with TempData): @TempData["counter"]</h4>
@{
	if((int)TempData["counter"] <= 3)
	{
		TempData.Keep("counter");
	}
}
@{
	// within controller
	if(TempData.ContainsKey("counter"))
	{
		TempData["counter"] = ((int)TempData["counter"]) + 1;
	} 
	else
	{
		TempData["counter"] = 0;
	}
}
		```
