- Project 3 
- QC tomorrow
- Panels Thursday at 9AM...

## Project 3 
- **NOTE TO SELF:** remember to remove the changes I made to test locally
	- within housing-forecast
		- dockerup.windev.yml
		    - Settings__ServiceHubConnection=DockerMachineHttp
		- appsettings.Development.json
			-  "ServiceHubConnection": "DockerMachineHttp"
	- within interface-web-forecast
		- in environment.ts we uncommented the url to test locally
- Goal, implement the average functionality from API

## Grilling Storm and possibly Matt K?
- Introduce yourself
	- my name
	- my school/major
	- being trained at revature and made 3 projects that more or less built on top of each other
		- project 0 
			- where we started off with having a big console application which was our UI
			- a library that held all business logic containing entity classes and repository logic
				- contains entity classes (customer, order, store, products, inventory, orderlist)
			- data access containing scaffolded EF DbContext
				- repositories implementation from the IRepo from the library project
				- and a mapper that ties in our data from db with our models
			- Test project for TDD with xUnit tests
				- logging with NLog
			- Technologies: C#/.NET, EF, Azure SQL DB, xUnit, NLog
		- project 1
			- built off of project 0, but instead of a big console application
				- we are now using ASP.NET MVC to allow more separation of concerns.
				- we leave our DAL and BLL mostly the same and all of the ui through MVC
					- based on user interactions, those url will make their way to the controller and an action method will be called accordingly. 
						- going to make order will make a post request that will save order into the db and then redirect user back to the previous page
		- Project 2
			- way more separation of concerns
				- 3 github repositories, 1 that contains ASP.NET Web API for our DAL, 1 for MVC as our UI, and the last one is Angular also for UI
				- Our MVC app was made solely for Authentication with asp.net core identity. Through the usage of cookies we were able to use user.id within our angular ui side
				- Angular app was where bulk of our trivia functionality lied to create and take quizzes as well as give reviews to how well we liked the quiz.
				- Our ASP.NET Web API was our way of getting URL from the UI and matching it with one of the routes defined within our controllers and taking action based on that. We then grab resource with that request and then send a response with the information back
- Week 1: 
	- class vs method and define them

	- what does a controller return? ActionResults (NOT A VIEW)
		- represents HTTP status codes 
	- controller actions and http verbs associated
	- asked about viewbags
	- routing
	- Validations for data model
	- Filters: what do you know and about ActionFilters
	- EntityFramework then you pick codefirst or database first then how to get data between

	- know the entry point of an angular program
	- no cloud stuffs
- Week 5
	- have you consumed an API?
	- SOAP or REST?
		- what is WCF
		- what is wsdl and different contracts
			- datacontract, servicecontract, operationcontract

## Repanel!
.....

### SQL
- ask her to type out each of these ...
- queries (SELECT, WHERE, GROUPBY, JOINS, etc...)
	- grab the names that has a higher salary than first name John
		- SELECT FIRST_NAME
		- FROM Employees
		- WHERE SALARY > (SELECT SALARY FROM Employee Where FIRST_NAME = 'John')
	- grab the average salaries of each department within a company
		- SELECT AVG(e.salary)
		- FROM Employee AS e
		- WHERE e.departmentId = (SELECT DISTINCT id FROM Department) -- where depid = 3 if we want from one department
		- GROUP BY e.salary
		-	```sql
			SELECT AVG(e.salary)
			FROM Employee AS e
			--JOIN Department as d ON e.departmentId = d.depId
			--GROUP BY d.depId
			GROUP BY e.departmentId
			```
	- grab the count of employees within each department
		- SELECT COUNT(e)
		- FROM EMPLOYEES as e
		- WHERE e.departmentId = (SELECT id FROM Department)
		- GROUPBY Department
		-	```sql
			SELECT e.departmentId, Count(e.empId)
			FROM Employee AS e
			GROUP BY e.departmentId
			ORDER BY e.departmentId
			```
- the rest are similar questions which i believe i answered correctly
	- DML
	- set Union vs Unionall
	- join vs union
	- normalizaton
	- scalar functions
	- clustered and nonclustered
	- phantom read
	- DbSet vs DataSet
