## LINQ
- [LINQ reference docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.linq.enumerable?view=netstandard-2.0)

## .NET
- is a platform for many languages
	- C# being the most popular
	- F#
	- VB.NET
	- Python
	- Java
	- R
	- Typescript/JS
- interoperability between languages
	- provides a lot of similar infrastructure to tie in other languages to work with one another
- defines a interfaces for anyone to make a .NET runtime
- **.NET Common language infrastructure (CLI)**
	- an interface standard for what a runtime has to have to be good
	- **virtual execution system (VES)**
	- **Common Type System (CTS)**
		- arrays belongs here
	- **Base Class Library (BCL)**
		- Lists and stuffs
- .NET Command-Line Interface (CLI) 
	- "dotnet" command that we use
- First step to build (1. .NET code in .cs file) -> (2. C# compiler using dotnet build,msbuild, csc ) -> (3. **intermediate language(IL)**)
	- 3 is called IL, CIL (common IL), MSIL (microsoft IL), bytecode, assembly
		- (.dll, .exe)
	- is an instruction set for the VES
		- VES is equivalent to Java JVM
- Second Step to run: Inside VES[(JIT compiler) -> (Native Instructions) -> (CPU runs)]
	- Just in time (JIT) compiler
- implementations...
	- .NET Framework (MS) v4.7~
		- Windows only 
		- msbuild back then instead of dotnet
	- .NET Core (MS) v2.2~
		- cross platform: write once, run anywhere
	- Mono 
		- is a port of framework for Mac/Linux
		- obsolete
- ADO.NET 
- ASP.NET (web based dev)
- WPF (windows style popups and form control, tied to Windows)
- WCF (web services)
