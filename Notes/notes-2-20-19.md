# Notes 2/20/19
- **REMINDER** grab sublime settings from mac
- also disable space to auto complete in VSCode
- add a ruler for VSCode
- learn shortcuts and possibly add my own
- go over unit testing fact later

## More Github
- origin master: remote tracking branch that tracks remote repo
- master is your local branch
	- master is the one we can modify all that we want
- fast forward merge: branch directly ahead and you run with `git merge someFeature` and merge your untracked changes
- think of branches like nodes with reference pointers, when you push you add a node at the end
- `git pull` is shortcut for git fetch and merge
	- fetch updates the remote tracking branches
	- merge: (with no args) merges the right r.t.b into the current branch
- merge commit brings all changes from different commits into one
	- you usually have to deal with merge conflicts at this point
- commit often, pull often, push often
- need know about base and this in terms of constructors
