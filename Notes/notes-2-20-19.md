# Notes 2/20/19
- **REMINDER** grab sublime settings from mac
- also disable space to auto complete in VSCode
- add a ruler for VSCode
- learn shortcuts and possibly add my own
- go over unit testing fact later
- Cognizant is our client

## More Github
- origin master: remote tracking branch that tracks remote repo
- master is your local branch
	- master is the one we can modify all that we want
- fast forward merge: branch directly ahead and you run with `git merge someFeature` and merge your untracked changes
- think of branches like nodes with reference pointers, when you push you add a node at the end
- `git pull` is shortcut for git fetch and merge
	- fetch updates the remote tracking branches
	- merge: (with no args) merges the right r.t.b into the current branch
- merge commit brings all changes from different commits into one
	- you usually have to deal with merge conflicts at this point
- commit often, pull often, push often
- need know about base and this in terms of constructors

## Collection Notes
- **base()** means if someone calls the zero param constructor
	- done by default
- fields or props default values are copied to every constructor
- by default T can be any type
- when you make a new class inheriting from another, all fields, methods, and props are inherited
	- constructors are not inherited
- every non abstract class has at least one constructor
- arrays: can make fixed length list of things
	- `int[] ints1 = new int[5]`
	- `int[] ints2 = new int[] { 1, 2, 3, 4, 50 };`
	- can go through array wth for loop or foreach
		- foreach can't change items in the array 
		- can have arrays of any type
		- `int[][] twoDArry = new int[9][];`
		- jagged array, each row could have diff len if we want
	- rarely use arrays except for performance
- Lists are more common and wide range of helpful functions
	- use .Add or init syntax for initial contents
	- 	```csharp
			var list = new ArrayList { 5, 8, 1 };
            list.AddRange(new int[] { 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 });
            list.Remove(8);
		```
	- can index into the list as if array
	- generics replaced ArrayLists since everything that got placed into Arraylists were converted into objects

## Testing:
- // usually write one test class to write one of our real classes
- manual testing... run the code in IDEs and plug in diff inputs and make sure we get expected output
- automated testing: write instructions for a test and the expected results, then we rerun lots of tests auto
	- this helps us find and solve bugs quicker for subsequent development
    - helps us design well in the first place
    - testable code is better designed code
- unit testing is a particular kind of automated testing
	- resolve to test the smallest pieces we can at a time
	- alternative is integration testing
- `[Fact]` if our 1st example of a c# attrib
- 3 general steps to unit test
	1. arrange
	2. act
	3. assert
- Subject under test(SUT): call obj that's being tested
- use Assert.True or false variable
- assertion succeeds if the right exception was thrown
	- fails if not thrown
- second type of xunit test is `[Theory]`
	- accept set of params to test against the code
