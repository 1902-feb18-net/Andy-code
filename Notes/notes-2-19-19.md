## GIT
- version control system (VCS)
	- aka source control managerment (SCM) tool
- distributed VCS (e.g. GIT)
	- everybody is the whole repo, everyone has a copy of the repo, backup, scalable
- others:
	- SVN (subversion)
	- hg (mercurial)
	- TFS (team foundation server)
- |0. stash|1. working directory/tree|2. index(staging area)|3. local repo|4. remote repo "origin" (Github)|
	- when you clone you get 1,2,3
	- 0. stack of temp. changes
	- 1. current state of files as fas as non-git aware programs can see
	- 2. temporary place to prepare for a commit
	- 3. permanent record history in commits
	- 4. someone's else history of commits
	- (local 	-> remote) by pushing and 
	- (remote 	-> anything downstream) with pull
	- working 	-> index with add
	- working 	<- index with reset
	- working 	<-> index with diff
	- index 	-> local with commit
	- index 	<-> local diff --cached
