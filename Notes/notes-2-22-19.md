# Revature Notes 2/22/19

## SOLID Principles
- *single-responsibility principle*
	- a class/method should just do one thing
- *Open Closed Principle*
	- entities should be open for **extension**, closed for modification
	- we like to see new behaviors that won't interfere with the old behaviors
	- try not to modify existing methods
- *Liskov Substitution Principle*
	- Objects should be replacable by instances of their subtypes
		- without altering the correctness of the code
		- e.g. `XmlSerializer : Serializer`
- *Interface Segregation Principle*
	- Many interfaces should be split up into many light interfaces
	- more free to extend stuffs later, instead of all or nothing with a heavy interface
- *Dependency Inversion Principle*
	- Instead of high level code depending on low level code or vice versa
		- both should depend on interfaces
		- When a class knows explicitly about the design and implementation of another class, it raises the risk that changes to one class will break the other class

## Other
- **is**: instead of `== null` we can use `is null`
	- similar to Python
- GAC: global assembly cache
	- C:\Windows\assembly
	- to achieve it, we created "strongly name" so that they must have version numbers
- NuGet:
	- package manager, replaces idea of global installation (e.g. GAC)
	- more local and not interfering, can get new version if we ask it to
	- easier to deploy apps to new systems
	- tied with `dotnet restore` or `nuget restore`
- errors: (from most serious to least)
	- most serious is fatal, aka critical
	- Warn/Warning
	- info
	- debug
	- trace
- Separation of Concerns
	- we minimize what we call tight coupling
	- being directly dependent on another class
	- wants to be a loose couple LOL
- Comment your code
	- use XML comments for the public API
	- inline comments to explain why we did something
- DRY: Don't repeat yourself
	- put into separate methods or classes if you find yourself repeating
- KISS: keep it simple stupid
	- making code that other coders can understand

## **REGULAR EXPRESSION**
	- [Rubular](https://rubular.com/) used to test regular expressions
	- e.g. "2019-02-22 10:30:54.0847 DEBUG logger created successfully"
		- with `[\d-]+ [\d:.]+ (\w+)`
		- we can grab the `DEBUG`
